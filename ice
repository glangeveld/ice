# Interactive Command Executor -- ice
#
# This program reads command lines one-by-one from a file and
# executes these command lines on request. For this purpose it
# runs a loop with the following steps:
#
# 1. Wait for the Enter key to be pressed
# 2. Show the command line that will be executed
# 3. Wait for the Enter key to be pressed
# 4. Execute the command line
# 5. Show shell prompt ('$' or '#') for the next command
# 6. Go to step 1
#
# Instead of pressing the Enter key for step 1 or 4, key 'q'
# can be pressed to finish this program immediately in a 
# proper way.
# In case of step 4 key 's' can be pressed to skip the command
# that has been shown.
#
# The only command line argument for this program is the name
# of the file that contains the command lines to be executed.
#
# When a command line in this file is preceded by a '!' it
# will be executed using 'sudo sh -c' (so with root privileges). 
# For this purpose it is advised to configure password-less
# sudo.
#
# When a line in this file starts with a '.' a red dot will be
# displayed for two seconds to indicate that a special action
# is required (e.g. showing results via another program during
# a demo).
#
# When a line in this file starts with a '#' it is skipped
# (comment). Also empty lines are skipped.
